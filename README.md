[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NSkelsey/ahimsarest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NSkelsey/ahimsarest)

A RESTful API that exposes bulletins stored in a blockchain. 
This is done through an intermediate sqlite database.
For the API to work in realtime a daemon like [ahimsad](https://github.com/NSkelsey/ahimsad) must be populating that database.
Your mileage may vary.

Documentation can be found [here]().
